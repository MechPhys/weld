title: "WELDBook EM"
---

-   start with wave in A_0, then show E_vec is gradient of that --
    show how to compute gradient
-   then A_vec and B --
-   sims: point charge and 1/r
-   relationship between A waves and EB waves..
-   spreading "photon" problem: this is not a problem for EM -- it is a
    problem for any physical theory -- photon model is so completely
    strange that it doesn't solve this problem..
