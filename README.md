# WELD: Wave Electrodynamics

This textbook provides an introduction to Wave Electrodynamics, designed to be accessible to someone with basic physics and calculus background, using numerical simulations and intuitive graphical displays to make the material concrete and accessible.

Wave electrodynamics is incredibly cool, but unfortunately has serious limitations as a accurate model of physics.  Nevertheless, it is very instructive for learning about a lot of different physical phenomenon in a very compact and intuitive way, using fun graphical simulations.  

The main limitation is that waves are just too sloppy -- they spill out all over the place and diffuse endlessly, and are not good for the precise accounting that nature seems to require.
